Gentoo Mass Deploy
==================

This project is a collection of scripts for mass deployment of Gentoo based upon a standard set of package requirements. I am tired of always having to type everything out to setup a new host. I figured it was time to automate this. At the same time I figured this would be a good project for me to learn Perl on.

What I hope to accomplish with this project is the automation of my installs based upon the end function of the system I am installing on. ie Webserver, MySQL server, DNS Server, etc. It is also my hope that through automation, I will be able to cut down on mistakes and memory loss while creating standard images of installs.
